# Wildcat Canyon Community School - WordPress to JAMstack Migration Log

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Migrate WordPress site (https://wildcatcanyon.org/) to a simple JAMstack-style static website while preserving page design and layout.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: EXACT CONTENT REPLICATION**
- All page content must be word-for-word replicas of the live site
- No optimization, rewriting, or improvement of existing content
- Maintain exact text, headings, formatting, and structure from wildcatcanyon.org
- Any content extraction must preserve original wording completely

**Client Requirements:**
- Preserve design and layout as closely as possible
- Simple content management for non-technical users
- No dynamic features needed (no comments, blog posts, store)
- Open source CMS solution preferred
- Capable front-end designer with CSS/HTML proficiency
- Comfortable with rewriting/adapting parts as needed

## Technology Stack Decision

**Final Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 with App Router + Tailwind CSS v4
- **CMS:** Git-based Decap CMS (open source)
- **Content:** Markdown files with frontmatter
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend) - $0/month
- **Database:** None (true JAMstack)
- **Versioning:** GitHub for content and code
- **Total Cost:** ~$0/month (vs $15-50/month WordPress hosting)

**Key Benefits:**
- Sub-second load times with static generation
- Automatic backups via Git history
- No server maintenance required
- Enhanced security (no WordPress vulnerabilities)
- Perfect Lighthouse scores potential

## Site Discovery Process

**Exploration Method:**
1. Screenshot capture of homepage
2. Navigation structure analysis
3. Systematic URL exploration
4. Content type identification

**Pages Discovered:** 45+ total pages

### Phase 1: Core Pages (15 pages) - PRIORITY
- Homepage (/) - Hero, programs, land acknowledgment, events
- Early Childhood (/early-childhood/)
- Lower School (/lower-school/) 
- Middle School (/middle-school/)

## Content Management Strategy

**Git-Based CMS Structure:**
\`\`\`
/content

\`\`\`

**Non-Technical User Workflow:**
1. Login to CMS at yoursite.com/admin
2. Edit content in rich text editor
3. Upload images through media manager
4. Save changes - automatically commits to GitHub
5. Site rebuilds automatically on Vercel (2-3 minutes)
