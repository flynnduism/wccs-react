# Wildcat Canyon Community School - WordPress to JAMstack Migration Log

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Migrate WordPress site (https://wildcatcanyon.org/) to a simple JAMstack-style static website while preserving page design and layout.

**Client Requirements:**
- Preserve design and layout as closely as possible
- Simple content management for non-technical users
- No dynamic features needed (no comments, blog posts, store)
- Open source CMS solution preferred
- Capable front-end designer with CSS/HTML proficiency
- Comfortable with rewriting/adapting parts as needed

## Technology Stack Decision

**Final Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 with App Router + Tailwind CSS v4
- **CMS:** Git-based Decap CMS (open source)
- **Content:** Markdown files with frontmatter
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend) - $0/month
- **Database:** None (true JAMstack)
- **Versioning:** GitHub for content and code
- **Total Cost:** ~$0/month (vs $15-50/month WordPress hosting)

**Key Benefits:**
- Sub-second load times with static generation
- Automatic backups via Git history
- No server maintenance required
- Enhanced security (no WordPress vulnerabilities)
- Perfect Lighthouse scores potential

**Non-Technical User Workflow:**

5. Site rebuilds automatically on Vercel (2-3 minutes)
