          <h2>Why Are We Inspired by Waldorf?</h2>
          
          <p>
            Our approach focuses on a comprehensive education that develops academic skills, visual and divergent thinking, social-emotional intelligence, and independent thought, carefully aligning curriculum with children's developmental stages.
          </p>

          <h3>A Developmental Approach to Education</h3>
          <p>
            We target learning readiness based on neuroscience, supporting healthy self-concept and positive learning attitudes.
          </p>

          <h3>Learning to Read in 1st Grade</h3>
          <p>
            We teach reading after Kindergarten when the brain is developmentally ready. Students love reading and often read at higher levels by 3rd grade.
          </p>

          <h3>Learning Through Hands-On Experiences</h3>
          <p>
            Students learn through doing and experiencing. This embodied learning wires concepts into neural networks.
          </p>

          <h3>Building Memory Capacity</h3>
          <p>
            We develop memory capacity through recitation, enhancing later learning and social skills.
          </p>

          <h3>Intentional Educational Design</h3>
          <p>
            Our purposeful daily structure includes coordinated lessons across subjects.
          </p>

          <h3>No Tests in Early Grades</h3>
          <p>
            We focus on learning for understanding rather than performance anxiety in the early years.
          </p>

          <h3>Authentic Assessment</h3>
          <p>
            We provide personalized feedback that encourages growth mindset without traditional grading.
          </p>

          <h3>Visual Thinking Skills</h3>
          <p>
            We build mental picturing skills to support creativity and imagination.
          </p>

          <h3>Exploring Multiple Perspectives</h3>
          <p>
            We teach systems thinking and develop empathy and understanding.
          </p>

          <h3>Students Creating Their Own Textbooks</h3>
          <p>
            Students write and illustrate their own learning materials, supporting retention and individual pride.
          </p>

          <h3>Developing Divergent and Convergent Thinking</h3>
          <p>
            We teach both types of thinking to help students tackle complex issues they'll face in the future.
          </p>

          <h3>A Nuanced Approach to Technology</h3>
          <p>
            We limit media in early years and teach responsible technology use as children develop.</p>
