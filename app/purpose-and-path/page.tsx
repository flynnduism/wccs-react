                After the closure of East Bay Waldorf School during the pandemic, Wildcat Canyon Community School
                sprouted from the compost of the former school. Inspired by the structure of backyard class pods that
                organically and collectively emerged during the year of pandemic closure, we reopened our doors as a
                parent/teacher cooperative with a mission of accessibility, inclusion, and Waldorf-inspired education.

                WCCS is a startup, grassroots school drawing its name from our beautiful campus adjacent to Wildcat
                Canyon. We are an independent AWSNA accredited school, self-managed and collaboratively led by three
                bodies: the faculty, the cooperative administration, and the Circle of Trustees.
