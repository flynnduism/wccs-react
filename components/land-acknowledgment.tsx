          We at Wildcat Canyon Community School honor the native peoples of this land, the Miwok and Ohlone peoples. We
          acknowledge that we are guests on their ancestral lands, that their sovereignty was never ceded. It was never
          given up, and that all of us native peoples to this land are settler occupiers, some brought against their
          will. We acknowledge the land itself as our first teacher, and we honor the generations of people who have
          been endowment that equally require a process of truth and reconciliation in our nation. We are committed to
          taking action as a community, listening to the pursuit of equity and honoring the land and its first peoples.
