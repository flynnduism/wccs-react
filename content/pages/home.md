# Welcome to Wildcat Canyon Community School

Wildcat Canyon Community School is reimagining Waldorf education and seeks to provide an inclusive, joyful, and immersive learning experience where students, PreK-8th, develop deep connections to the indigenous land, the seasons, self, and the community.

## Our Programs

We offer comprehensive programs from Early Childhood through Middle School, each designed to nurture the whole child through developmentally appropriate Waldorf education.

## Land Acknowledgment

We at Wildcat Canyon Community School honor the native peoples of this land, the Miwok and Ohlone peoples. We acknowledge that we are guests on their ancestral lands, that their sovereignty was never ceded. It was never given up, and that all of us native peoples to this land are settler occupiers, some brought against their will. We acknowledge the land itself as our first teacher, and we honor the generations of people who have been endowed that equally require a process of truth and reconciliation in our nation. We are committed to taking action as a community, listening to the pursuit of equity and honoring the land and its first peoples.
